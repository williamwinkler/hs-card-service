# Hearthstone Card Service
Serves cards from Blizzards card game [Hearthstone](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us).

The very purpose of this program was to personally get well acquainted with Swagger codegen, Clean Architecture and MongoDb. <br>
The program gets its data from [Blizzards Hearthstone API](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/hearthstone/game-data-apis) and stores it in a mongoDB database.

## API
The API is defined in [./api/swagger.yml](./api/swagger.yml) which is used to generate the server located in [./codegen](./codegen/). <br>
The API can be seen [here on SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/WILLIAMBWINKLER/hearthstone-card-service/1.0.0#/) or on `/docs` when running.<br>

When changes made to the swagger file the REST API can be regenerated by running the following script:
```bash
./scripts/generate_swagger.sh
```

## Testing
Tests are located in [./internal/tests](./internal/tests/) and mocks are created with `mockery`.<br>
To run tests:
```bash
go test ./internal/tests/...
```
To recreate mocks:
```bash
./scripts/generate_mocks.sh
```
